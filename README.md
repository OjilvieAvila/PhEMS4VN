Code to be run under simulation environments Omnet++ 6.0.1 and Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) 1.16.00 and frameworks Veins 5.2 and Inet 4.4 
Simulators were set up as recommended by Dr. Joanne Skiles tutorials found at https://www.youtube.com/@DrJoanneSkiles on a Linux Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS x64 machine
The whole project is based on the original veins-inet project from veins samples by Cristoph Sommer 

Once the simulators were set, vehicular densities can be changed in the square.rou.xml files, in the respective approach (pheromone, flooding-c or flooding-r), to 60.0, 120.0, 180.0, 240.0, 300.0 and 360.00 vehsPerHour (equvivalent to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 veh/min*route) flows rows
